# Dice Game

I have created a dice game , Only 2 players can play it.

### Here are the rules :

The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.

In each turn, a player rolls 2 dice as many times as he wishes.

Each result will get added to his round’s score.

But if the player rolls a double six all his round’s score gets lost.

After that, it's the next player’s turn.

A player can choose to ‘Hold’, which means that his round’s score gets added to his global score.

After that, it's the next player's turn.

The first player to reach 100 points wins.[You can change the goal]

If you want to reset the scores , click on the reset game button.
